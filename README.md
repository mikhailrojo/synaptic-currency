### Neuronet tryouts ###

I was trying to put my hand on neuronetwork with synaptic.js
I created a Perceptron with 3 layers and parced data of currencies from 2007 to 2017 for 6 currencies.

- Australian
- Belorusian
- Euro
- Japan
- Swiss
- USD

I used first 5 as inputs to the NET, and USD as a output for training. Supposedly the NET should predict current currancy rate USD/RUB
As a result, a got:

```
Training started with 2481 sets for training
First training input: { input: [ 21, 35, 11, 21, 21 ],
                        output: [ 0.30120481927710846 ] }
Training ended
Current USD value supposed to be 59.24262096102017 RUB per 1 USD
